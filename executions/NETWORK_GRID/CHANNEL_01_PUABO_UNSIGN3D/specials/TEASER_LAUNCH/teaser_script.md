**Duration:** 30 Minutes
**Status:** TEST RUN (LIVE)

## BLOCK 1: THE WAKE UP (00:00 - 05:00)
**Tone:** Urgent, Raw, Unfiltered.
**Visual:** Close up, dim lighting.

*(Music: Low rumble, building tension)*

"We are live. This isn't a rehearsal. This isn't a pilot. This is the awakening."

"They told us we needed a label. They told us we needed permission. They told us we needed to wait our turn."

"Look at the screen. Who's broadcasting? Me. Who's owning the signal? Us."

## BLOCK 2: THE MISSION (05:00 - 15:00)
**Tone:** Authoritative, Educational.
**Visual:** Graphics overlay (N3XUS Logo).

"Why are we here? Because 'Unsigned' became a dirty word. It became code for 'unwanted'."

"I'm flipping the script. Unsigned means **Unbound**. It means **Unlimited**."

"For the next 30 minutes, I'm not interviewing anyone. I'm interviewing *you*. Are you ready to work? Or do you just want to be famous?"

## BLOCK 3: THE TECH REVEAL (15:00 - 25:00)
**Tone:** Proud, Tech-Savvy.
**Visual:** Screen share of v-Hollywood Dashboard.

"You think this is Zoom? You think this is Instagram Live?"

*(Gestures to virtual set)*

"This is **PUABO v-STUDIOS**. Sovereign code. No middleman taking 40%. No algorithm hiding my voice."

"I built this for us. The N3XUS v-COS. It's not just a show, it's an operating system."

## BLOCK 4: THE CALL TO ACTION (25:00 - 30:00)
**Tone:** High Energy, Hype.
**Visual:** Full brightness, dynamic camera moves.

"This was just the mic check."

"**Monday. Episode 1. The Come Up.**"

"I want you in the chat. I want you on the readiness clock. If you have 80%, I'll give you the 20%. But you better bring the 80."

"My name is Bobby Blanco. This is PUABO UNSIGN3D."

"Mic check complete. We live."

*(FADE TO BLACK)*
