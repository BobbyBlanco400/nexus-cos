**(Host to Camera)**  
What’s good, fam?  
I’m Bobby Blanco, and this is **PUABO UNSIGN3D N3X-Liv3!**  

This ain’t an interview show.  
This ain’t a panel.  
This is a live open mic for the unsigned who are really working.  

Tonight, I’m choosing guests live.  
No pre-booking.  
No favoritism.  
If you earned the mic, you claim it.  

Unsigned don’t mean unready.  
Let’s get to it!

## [--- SEGMENT 2 — CULTURE & GAME | 5:00–15:00 ---]
**[CUE: Medium → Tight shots]**  
**[Overlay: "Discipline > Talent", subtle chat B-roll]**  

**(Host)**  
Being unsigned is not the problem.  
Being undisciplined is.  

Most artists don’t need a deal.  
They need structure.  
They need consistency.  
They need honesty.  

If you can’t post consistently,  
if you can’t finish records,  
if you can’t take feedback,  
the industry isn’t the issue.  

Fix the basics.  
Then earn the mic.

## [--- SEGMENT 4 — HOST REALITY CHECK | 45:00–55:00 ---]
**[CUE: Tight close-up, push-in, B-roll guest clips]**  
**[Music: Fade underscore]**  

**(Host)**  
Here’s what tonight showed me.  

Talent is everywhere.  
Discipline is rare.  

The artists who stood out weren’t perfect —  
they were prepared.  

If you watched tonight and didn’t get picked,  
don’t complain.  
Improve.  

This mic isn’t going anywhere.  
Earn your moment.
