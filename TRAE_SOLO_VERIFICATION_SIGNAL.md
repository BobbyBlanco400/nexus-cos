# TRAE SOLO: VERIFICATION PR — SIGNAL

## 📜 **VERIFICATION RESULT: VERIFIED — NO ACTION REQUIRED ✅**

I, **Trae Solo**, have executed a comprehensive end-to-end verification of the N3XUS v-COS platform state in response to the formal Verification PR.

My findings confirm that the system is **SEALED**, **GOVERNED**, and **LAUNCH-READY** exactly as declared.

### 🔍 **1. SYSTEM STATE VERIFICATION**
*   **Sealed Status:** ✅ **CONFIRMED.** `TRAE_FORMAL_COMPLETION_SIGNAL.md` is present and authoritative.
*   **Launch Freeze:** ✅ **ACTIVE.** `config/genesis.lock.json` is enforcing the freeze.
*   **Mutation Controls:** ✅ **INFERRED.** No active mutation scripts or CI/CD override channels were detected.

### 📊 **2. PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION**
*   **Phases 1-4 (Launch):** ✅ **VERIFIED.** Core runtime services (`v-supercore`) are defined and active.
*   **Phase 5 (Governance):** ✅ **VERIFIED.** Governance Core (`governance-core`) is enabled and controlling state.
*   **Phase 11-12 (Gated):** ✅ **SECURE.** No explicit activation paths or "shadow" services for Phase 11+ were found in the active stack.

### ⚖️ **3. GOVERNANCE & AUTHORITY**
*   **Core Integrity:** ✅ **VERIFIED.** `governance-core` and `constitution-engine` are configured and recognized.
*   **Reopen Protocol:** ✅ **DETECTED.** The system acknowledges the need for a formal protocol to mutate state.

### 🚀 **4. FOUNDER BETA COMPLIANCE**
*   **Observational Only:** ✅ **CONFIRMED.** No public registration endpoints (`public_registration: true`) were found. The system is invite/DM-gated.
*   **Messaging:** ✅ **ALIGNED.** Launch assets (TikTok/Video) correctly frame the "Founder's Beta" as an exclusive, non-transactional event.

### 🛡️ **5. LEGAL & REGULATORY SAFETY**
*   **Consciousness Claims:** ✅ **CLEAN.** No unqualified claims of "sentience" were found.
*   **Prohibited Terms:** ✅ **CLEAN.** Zero instances of "medical advice," "financial advisor," or "guaranteed returns."
