# Phase 2.5 OTT Integration - Enforcement Guide

**Document Purpose:** Bulletproof guide for TRAE Solo to follow Phase 2.5 deployment EXACTLY  
**PF ID:** PF-HYBRID-FULLSTACK-2025.10.07-PHASE-2.5  
**Enforcement Mode:** ZERO TOLERANCE - STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIRED  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-08

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: THIS IS MANDATORY 🚨

**This guide is NOT optional. This guide is NOT a suggestion. This guide is MANDATORY.**

Every step in this guide MUST be followed exactly as written, in order, with NO deviations.

---

## Why This Guide Exists

The Phase 2.5 PF directive requires TRAE Solo (automated deployment agent) to:
1. Deploy THREE system layers (OTT, V-Suite, Beta) successfully
2. Configure dual-domain routing correctly
3. Deploy landing pages without errors
4. Validate EVERYTHING before considering deployment complete

**The Problem:** Previous attempts may have skipped steps, ignored warnings, or proceeded despite errors.

**The Solution:** This enforcement guide makes it IMPOSSIBLE to skip steps or proceed with errors.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria (ALL Must Be Met)

Your Phase 2.5 deployment is ONLY successful if ALL of these are true:

- [ ] ✅ Deployment script exits with code 0 (success)
- [ ] ✅ Deployment script shows green success box
- [ ] ✅ All landing pages deployed to correct locations
- [ ] ✅ Nginx configuration applied and tested
- [ ] ✅ Nginx service reloaded without errors
- [ ] ✅ Validation script exits with code 0 (success)
- [ ] ✅ Validation script shows "ALL CHECKS PASSED"
- [ ] ✅ ZERO failed checks in validation output
- [ ] ✅ Both https://nexuscos.online and https://beta.nexuscos.online are accessible

**If ANY of these are false, the deployment is INCOMPLETE and MUST be fixed.**

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Mandatory Execution

### Pre-Execution Checklist

**STOP! Before running ANY commands, verify ALL of these:**

```bash
# 1. Verify you are root
whoami
# Expected: root

# 2. Verify repository location
ls /opt/nexus-cos/scripts/deploy-phase-2.5-architecture.sh
# Expected: file exists

# 3. Verify landing pages exist
ls /opt/nexus-cos/apex/index.html
ls /opt/nexus-cos/web/beta/index.html
# Expected: both files exist

# 4. Verify Docker is running
systemctl is-active docker
# Expected: active

# 5. Verify Nginx is installed
which nginx
# Expected: /usr/sbin/nginx or similar
```

**If ANY of these checks fail, STOP and fix before proceeding.**

---

### Step 1: Deploy Phase 2.5 Architecture

**Execute these commands EXACTLY in this order:**

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd /opt/nexus-cos

# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy-phase-2.5-architecture.sh

# Run deployment
sudo ./scripts/deploy-phase-2.5-architecture.sh
```

**Wait for deployment to complete. Do NOT interrupt.**

---

### Step 2: Verify Deployment Success

**You MUST see this exact output at the end:**

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        ✅  PHASE 2.5 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - SUCCESS  ✅         ║
║              ALL MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS MET                    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

✅ STATUS: PRODUCTION READY - ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ✅
```

**If you see ANYTHING different:**
- ❌ Red error boxes = FAILED
- ❌ "DEPLOYMENT INCOMPLETE" = FAILED
- ❌ "CHECKS FAILED" = FAILED
- ❌ Any error messages = FAILED

**IF FAILED: STOP immediately. Read error messages. Fix issues. Re-run from Step 1.**

---

### Step 3: Run Mandatory Validation

**This step CANNOT be skipped. It is MANDATORY.**

```bash
# Make validation script executable
chmod +x scripts/validate-phase-2.5-deployment.sh

# Run validation
sudo ./scripts/validate-phase-2.5-deployment.sh
```

**Wait for validation to complete. Do NOT interrupt.**

---

### Step 4: Verify Validation Success

**You MUST see this exact output at the end:**

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED ✅                         ║
║         Phase 2.5 Deployment is Production Ready!              ║
║         ALL MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS MET                         ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

✅ STATUS: PRODUCTION READY - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE ✅
```

**If you see:**
- ✅ "ALL CHECKS PASSED" = SUCCESS, proceed to Step 5
- ❌ "VALIDATION FAILED" = FAILED, go back to Step 1
- ❌ "Checks Failed: X" where X > 0 = FAILED, go back to Step 1

---

### Step 5: Manual Verification (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Test landing pages
curl -I https://nexuscos.online
curl -I https://beta.nexuscos.online

# Both should return: HTTP/2 200
```

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to AVOID

### ❌ DO NOT Do These Things:

1. **DO NOT skip validation** - It is MANDATORY
2. **DO NOT proceed if any checks fail** - Fix errors first
3. **DO NOT manually edit files after deployment** - Use scripts only
4. **DO NOT ignore warning messages** - They indicate potential issues
5. **DO NOT assume "close enough" is good enough** - ALL checks must pass
6. **DO NOT skip landing page deployment** - Both are REQUIRED
7. **DO NOT proceed without green success boxes** - Red = failure

---

## ✅ What Success Looks Like

### Visual Indicators of Success:

1. **Green boxes** with ✅ symbols
2. **"ALL CHECKS PASSED"** message
3. **"PRODUCTION READY"** status
4. **Zero "✗" marks** in output
5. **Exit code 0** from scripts

### File System Indicators:

```bash
# These files MUST exist:
/var/www/nexuscos.online/index.html
/var/www/beta.nexuscos.online/index.html
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nexuscos
/opt/nexus-cos/logs/phase2.5/ott/
/opt/nexus-cos/logs/phase2.5/beta/
/opt/nexus-cos/scripts/beta-transition-cutover.sh
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: "Landing page not found"

**Cause:** Repository doesn't have landing page files  
**Fix:**
```bash
cd /opt/nexus-cos
git pull origin main
ls apex/index.html web/beta/index.html
# Verify files exist, then re-run deployment
```

### Error: "Nginx configuration failed"

**Cause:** Syntax error in Nginx config  
**Fix:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t
# Read error message
# Fix configuration file shown in error
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Error: "Permission denied"

**Cause:** Not running as root  
**Fix:**
```bash
sudo -i
cd /opt/nexus-cos
# Re-run deployment
```

### Error: "Docker not running"

**Cause:** Docker service stopped  
**Fix:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
# Re-run deployment
```

## 📊 Validation Checklist

After deployment AND validation, verify ALL of these:

- [ ] Green success box from deployment script
- [ ] Green success box from validation script
- [ ] "ALL CHECKS PASSED" in validation output
- [ ] Checks Failed: 0 (MUST be zero)
- [ ] /var/www/nexuscos.online/index.html exists
- [ ] /var/www/beta.nexuscos.online/index.html exists
- [ ] Nginx is running: `systemctl is-active nginx` = active
- [ ] Landing pages accessible via curl
- [ ] No errors in /opt/nexus-cos/logs/phase2.5/*/error.log

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked, deployment is INCOMPLETE.**

---

## 🎓 Learning From This Guide

### Key Principles:

1. **Validation is NOT optional** - It's part of the deployment process
2. **Errors MUST be fixed** - Not ignored, not worked around
3. **Scripts are authoritative** - Follow them exactly
4. **Green = Good, Red = Bad** - Visual feedback is clear
5. **ALL means ALL** - Not "most", not "almost all", but ALL

### Why Enforcement Matters:

- **Reliability:** Ensures deployments work consistently
- **Debugging:** Makes problems obvious instead of hidden
- **Documentation:** Scripts document the exact process
- **Automation:** Enables automated deployments
- **Quality:** Maintains high standards

## 📞 Support and Help

### If deployment fails repeatedly:

1. Review ALL error messages carefully
2. Check the troubleshooting section above
3. Verify pre-execution checklist is complete
4. Read the error logs: `tail -f /opt/nexus-cos/logs/phase2.5/*/error.log`
5. Consult PF_PHASE_2.5_OTT_INTEGRATION.md for details

## 🎯 Final Reminder

**This is NOT a suggestion. This is NOT optional. This is MANDATORY.**

- ✅ Follow every step exactly
- ✅ Run all validation scripts
- ✅ Fix all errors before proceeding
- ✅ Verify ALL success criteria
- ✅ Do NOT skip anything

**Your deployment is ONLY complete when validation shows "ALL CHECKS PASSED".**
