# üöÄ Nexus COS - VPS Deployment Guide

> **For Agent TRAE SOLO**: Your deployment scripts are now fixed and ready for VPS production deployment!

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

Your deployment scripts had hardcoded GitHub Actions paths that prevented them from working on your VPS. **This has been completely resolved**.

### Before (‚ùå Broken)
```bash
REPO_ROOT="/home/runner/work/nexus-cos/nexus-cos"  # Only works in GitHub Actions
```

### After (‚úÖ Fixed)
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
REPO_ROOT="${REPO_ROOT:-$SCRIPT_DIR}"  # Works anywhere!
```

---

## üéØ What You Need To Do Now

### Step 1: Upload Repository to Your VPS

Upload the repository to `/var/www/nexus-cos` on your VPS.

### Step 2: Run These Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Copy these commands EXACTLY as shown. Do NOT include any leading hyphens or bullets.

```bash
cd /var/www/nexus-cos
ls -l pf-master-deployment.sh
sudo chmod +x /var/www/nexus-cos/pf-master-deployment.sh
sudo DOMAIN=nexuscos.online bash /var/www/nexus-cos/pf-master-deployment.sh
```

### Step 3: Validate Deployment

```bash
sudo bash /var/www/nexus-cos/validate-ip-domain-routing.sh
```

### Step 4: Test in Browser

1. **Clear your browser cache** (Very Important!)
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (or `Cmd + Option + E` on Mac)
   - Select "All time" or "Everything"
   - Clear cached images and files

2. **Open these URLs**:
   - `http://74.208.155.161/`
   - `https://nexuscos.online/`

3. **Verify**:
   - Both URLs should show the SAME UI/branding
   - HTTP should redirect to HTTPS
   - You should see your official Nexus COS interface

## üîç Spot-Check Commands

Run these to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check HTTP redirect from IP
curl -I http://74.208.155.161/

# Check HTTPS domain
curl -I https://nexuscos.online/

# Check admin panel
curl -I https://nexuscos.online/admin

# Check API health
curl -I https://nexuscos.online/api/health
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "-: command not found"

**Cause**: You copied the command with a leading hyphen/bullet from documentation.

**Solution**: Type the command manually or copy it without any leading characters:

```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG (has leading hyphen)
- cd /var/www/nexus-cos

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
cd /var/www/nexus-cos
```

### Issue: "pf-master-deployment.sh not found"

**Solution**: Make sure you're in the correct directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/nexus-cos
pwd  # Should show: /var/www/nexus-cos
ls -la pf-master-deployment.sh  # Should show the file
```

### Issue: Nginx fails to reload

**Solution**:

```bash
# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Check logs
sudo tail -n 200 /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
