## 🎯 PLATFORM OVERVIEW

### What is Nexus COS?

Nexus COS (Casino Operating System) is not a single casino—it's an **operating system for running unlimited virtual casinos** on shared infrastructure. Think of it as the "AWS for online casinos" or the "virtual Las Vegas Strip."

**Core Concept:**
```
Traditional Model: One Platform = One Casino
Casino Nexus Model: One Platform = 100+ Unique Casinos
```

### The Vegas Strip Metaphor

Just as the Las Vegas Strip hosts multiple casinos (Bellagio, Aria, Caesars) on one street with shared infrastructure but unique identities, Nexus COS hosts multiple virtual casinos on one platform.

**Real Vegas Strip:**
- Multiple casinos on Las Vegas Boulevard
- Each with unique theme and identity
- Tourists walk between properties
- Shared power grid, roads, services

**Nexus COS Virtual Strip:**
- Multiple casinos on one platform
- Each with unique theme and identity
- Players hop between casinos seamlessly
- Shared RNG, payments, compliance
