# CANON SOVEREIGNTY DECLARATION

**Authority:** Canonical  
**Applies To:** N3XUS COS (All Environments)  
**Enforced By:** canon-verifier  
**Handshake:** 55-45-17

---

## Overview

This document defines what N3XUS COS SHALL NOT become.

Canon-verifier does not merely validate execution.  
It enforces sovereign constraints on system identity.

Violation of any clause below mandates an automatic **NO-GO**.

---

## SOVEREIGN REFUSALS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

N3XUS COS SHALL NOT:

### 1. False Operating System Declaration

Declare itself an operating system if any core lifecycle chain (Identity → MetaTwin → Runtime) is unverifiable through observable execution.

### 2. Unverified Canonical Services

Mark any service as canonical unless it demonstrates at least one of the following in live runtime:
- API response
- Event emission or consumption
- State mutation
- Log evidence of execution
- Artifact generation

### 3. Duplicate Authorities

Allow multiple services to claim the same canonical responsibility without an explicit, observable arbitration mechanism.

### 4. Invalidated Canon Conditions

Continue execution under a GO verdict if any previously verified canon condition becomes invalid.

### 5. Masked System States

Mask degraded, partial, or ornamental systems as operational or production-ready.

### 6. Compromised Dependencies

Permit mocked, hard-coded, or bypassed dependencies in production runtime paths.

### 7. Non-Executing Declarations

Accept concept-only modules, documentation-only services, or non-executing declarations as canon.

---

## CANON ENFORCEMENT RULE

If any sovereignty clause is violated:

- canon-verifier MUST issue **NO-GO**
- Execution MUST halt
- No remediation, fallback, or continuation is permitted

**Canon truth supersedes convenience.**

---

## FINAL ASSERTION

N3XUS COS is not defined by what it claims.  
It is defined by what it can prove —  
and what it refuses to pretend.

**This is Canon Sovereignty.**

---

## Integration with N3XUS Law

**Official Name:** Canon Sovereignty Mode (CSM)

**Legal / Canon Standing:** Equal authority to Handshake 55-45-17

**Enforced by:** canon-verifier

**Status:** Non-optional in production

**One-Line Definition:**  
Canon Sovereignty Mode ensures N3XUS COS cannot misrepresent itself, even under pressure.

---

## What This Ensures

The system cannot:
- Lie about its capabilities
- Drift silently from verified state
- Be diluted by future changes
- Be "mostly true" or partially operational

This is not a feature.  
**This is institutional immunity.**
