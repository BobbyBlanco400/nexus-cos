## TRAE Activation Procedures

### Method 1: Automated Activation (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/nexus-cos/nexus-cos
./trae-activate.sh
```

**This will**:
1. Run final pre-activation validation
2. Execute TRAE Solo deployment (`deploy-trae-solo.sh`)
3. Perform post-activation health checks
4. Generate detailed activation report

### Method 2: Direct TRAE Deployment

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/nexus-cos/nexus-cos
./deploy-trae-solo.sh
```

**This will**:
1. Check TRAE Solo installation
2. Validate configuration
3. Install dependencies
4. Build applications
5. Deploy with TRAE Solo orchestration
6. Run health checks

### Method 3: NPM Script

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/nexus-cos/nexus-cos
npm run trae:deploy
```

**This will**:
- Execute TRAE Solo CLI deployment
- Orchestrate all services
- Follow TRAE Solo deployment flow

---

## Post-Activation Verification

### Health Check Commands

```bash
# Check service status
npm run trae:status

# View service logs
npm run trae:logs

# Run health checks
npm run trae:health

# Test individual services
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### Expected Behavior

After TRAE activation:
1. All services should start successfully
2. Health endpoints should respond with `{"status":"ok"}`
3. Frontend should be accessible
4. APIs should respond to requests
5. Load balancer should route traffic correctly
6. SSL certificates should be configured (production)
