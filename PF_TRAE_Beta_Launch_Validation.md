# TRAE Production Finalization (PF) & Beta Launch Validation

## 1. File & Config Deployment
- [x] All critical configs (`nginx.conf.docker`, `nginx.conf.host`) are versioned and present in the repo.
- [x] Interactive deployment one-liner is documented and ready.
- [x] README (`NGINX_CONFIGURATION_README.md`) explains all modes and steps.

## 2. Compose Network Finalization
- [x] All services are present in `docker-compose.yml` under a shared network (`cos-net`).
- [x] Volumes are configured for persistent data.
- [x] Healthchecks are defined for each major service.

## 3. Nginx Validation
- [x] Nginx config matches deployment mode (Docker/Host).
- [x] `sudo nginx -t` passes validation.
- [x] Nginx reloads without error.

## 4. Security & Access
- [x] SSL/TLS enabled and tested (`https://nexuscos.online`).
- [x] Only required ports are exposed.
- [x] Secrets managed via `.env`, not hardcoded.

## 5. Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Nginx access/error logs are active.
- [x] Application logs are persistent.
- [x] (Optional) Monitoring containers (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) active.

## 6. Full System Check / Beta Launch Validation

### Core Endpoint Check
```sh
for url in /api /admin /v-suite/prompter /health /health/gateway /health/puaboai-sdk /health/pv-keys; do curl -I https://nexuscos.online$url; done
```
- [x] All endpoints respond 200/301/302

### Service Health Validation
- [x] `test-pf-configuration.sh` passes for all services

### Database & Dependencies
- [x] Database is reachable and healthy
- [x] Dependencies are up-to-date after `git pull`

### Secrets & Credentials
- [x] No secrets or credentials are in the codebase

## 7. Beta Launch Workflow

1. Choose Nginx deployment mode (Docker/Host).
2. Run the interactive one-liner:
    ```sh
    echo "Choose Nginx mode: [1] Docker [2] Host"; read mode; if [ "$mode" = "1" ]; then sudo cp nginx.conf.docker /etc/nginx/nginx.conf; else sudo cp nginx.conf.host /etc/nginx/nginx.conf; fi && git stash && git pull origin main && sudo cp nginx/conf.d/nexus-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/ && sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload && [ -f test-pf-configuration.sh ] && chmod +x test-pf-configuration.sh && ./test-pf-configuration.sh && for url in /api /admin /v-suite/prompter /health /health/gateway /health/puaboai-sdk /health/pv-keys; do curl -I https://nexuscos.online$url; done
    ```
3. Review logs and curl output.
4. Announce Beta launch!
