# Canonical Tenant Registry — N3XUSCOS Platform

**Status:** LOCKED AND CANONICAL
**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025
**Authority:** Immutable

## Platform Architecture

N3XUSCOS is a **Platform-of-Platforms** (Creative Operating System) that hosts independent streaming mini-platforms, not creators.

### What N3XUSCOS IS:
✅ Platform-of-Platforms
✅ Creative Operating System
✅ Revenue-enforced infrastructure
✅ Multi-tenant streaming platform

### What N3XUSCOS IS NOT:
❌ A media app
❌ A streaming site
❌ A single marketplace
❌ A creator-hosting platform

## 12 Independent Streaming Mini Platforms

These are **first-class tenants**, not internal modules. Each operates autonomously with:
- Independent branding, content, and audience
- Autonomous streaming operations
- Shared infrastructure only
- Complete isolation (container + ledger boundary)
- Cannot see or affect other tenants

| # | Tenant Name | Status | Platform Type |
|---|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Club Saditty | Active | Entertainment & Lifestyle |
| 2 | Faith Through Fitness | Active | Health & Wellness |
| 3 | Ashanti's Munch & Mingle | Active | Food & Community |
| 4 | Ro Ro's Gaming Lounge | Active | Gaming & Esports |
| 5 | IDH Live | Active | Talk Show & Discussion |
| 6 | Clocking T | Active | Urban Entertainment |
| 7 | Tyshawn Dance Studio | Active | Dance & Performing Arts |
| 8 | Fayeloni Kreation | Active | Creative Arts |
| 9 | Sassie Lashes | Active | Beauty & Fashion |
| 10 | Neenee & Kids | Active | Family & Children |
| 11 | Headwina's Comedy Club | Active | Comedy & Entertainment |
| 12 | Rise Sacramento 916 – Gas or Crash Live | Active | Local Community & Talk |

**IMPORTANT:** "Boom Boom Room Live" has been REPLACED by "Faith Through Fitness" (Tenant #2)

## Revenue Enforcement (Ledger-Level)

The platform enforces an **80/20 revenue split**:

- **80%** → Tenant (platform owner)
- **20%** → N3XUSCOS (platform infrastructure)

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Non-configurable
- ✅ Non-bypassable
- ✅ Enforced at settlement, not UI
- ✅ Ledger-level enforcement
- ✅ Per-tenant isolation

## Economic Model

```
N3XUSCOS = 
  78 container-ready services
  + 8 embedded engines
  + 24 platform layers
  + 12 independent streaming mini platforms
```

## Tenant Capabilities

Each tenant platform has:

### Autonomous Operations
- Own branding and content strategy
- Independent audience management
- Autonomous streaming pipeline
- Custom monetization models
- Independent analytics

### Shared Infrastructure
- Container orchestration
- Database layer
- Streaming infrastructure
- Authentication services
- Payment processing
- AI/ML services

### Isolation Boundaries
- **Container-level:** Separate namespaces
- **Ledger-level:** Independent accounts
- **Data-level:** No cross-tenant access
- **Network-level:** Isolated communication
- **Billing-level:** Separate settlement

## Architectural Wiring

### 1. Tenant Layer (LOCKED)
- Tenant count: **12 (immutable)**
- Federation-aware
- Streaming-native
- Ledger-isolated

### 2. Control Panel Integration
- Tenant = platform entity, not feature
- Permissions per tenant
- Revenue monitoring per tenant
- Kill/pause per tenant (no blast radius)

### 3. Verification Layer
Automated validation must assert:
- ✅ Tenant count = 12
- ✅ Revenue split = 80/20
- ✅ Isolation boundaries intact
- ✅ No shared wallets
- ✅ Independent stream pipelines

**If any mismatch → deployment fails**

## Investor Value Proposition

### Clean Story
"N3XUSCOS is a revenue-enforced operating system that hosts independent streaming businesses, not creators."

### Key Signals
1. **Predictable Platform Revenue** - 20% of all tenant revenue
2. **No Content Risk** - Tenants own their content liability
3. **Built-in Diversification** - 12 independent revenue streams
4. **Platform Gravity** - High switching costs for tenants
5. **Horizontal Scaling** - Add more tenants without architectural changes

### Platform Metrics
- **Total Tenants:** 12
- **Revenue Share:** 80% tenant / 20% platform
- **Service Layer:** 78 services
- **Engines:** 8 embedded
- **Platform Layers:** 24
- **Uptime Target:** 99.9%

## Compliance & Governance

### SOC-2 Compliance
- Per-tenant audit trails
- Immutable transaction logs
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control
- Network segmentation

### Data Governance
- GDPR/CCPA compliant
- Per-tenant data sovereignty
- Right to erasure support
- Data portability options
- Privacy by design

## Technical Integration Points

### N.E.X.U.S AI Control Panel
- **Tenant Management:** View all 12 tenant platforms
- **Revenue Monitoring:** Real-time 80/20 split tracking
- **Health Monitoring:** Per-tenant service health
- **Emergency Controls:** Per-tenant lockdown (isolated)
- **Analytics:** Aggregated and per-tenant metrics

### Verification Scripts
```bash
# Verify tenant count
./nexus-ai/verify/verify-tenants.sh

# Must assert:
# - Exactly 12 tenants configured
# - 80/20 revenue split enforced
# - Isolation boundaries intact
```

### Ledger Service
- Maintains separate ledger per tenant
- Enforces 80/20 split at settlement time
- Immutable transaction records
- Real-time revenue reporting
- Automated reconciliation

## Deployment Requirements

### Mandatory Checks
Before any deployment, verify:
1. ✅ Tenant count = 12
2. ✅ All tenants have independent ledgers
3. ✅ Revenue split = 80/20 for all tenants
4. ✅ Container isolation configured
5. ✅ Network policies enforce isolation
6. ✅ No shared database tables between tenants

### Rejected Patterns
❌ Modeling tenants as modules
❌ Shared wallet systems
❌ Configurable revenue splits
❌ Cross-tenant data access
❌ Centralized content storage

## Migration Notes

### Historical Correction
- **Previous:** References to "21 tenants" are superseded
- **Current:** 12 Independent Streaming Mini Platforms
- **Clarification:** Other entities are services, engines, or layers

### Tenant #2 Change
- **Old:** Boom Boom Room Live
- **New:** Faith Through Fitness
- **Effective:** December 25, 2025
- **Impact:** All documentation updated
