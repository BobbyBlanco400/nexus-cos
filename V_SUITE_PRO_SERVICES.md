## Implementation Details

### File Structure

Each service includes:
```
services/v-[service-name]/
├── server.js       # Express server with endpoints
├── package.json    # NPM configuration
└── README.md       # Service documentation
```

### Dependencies

All services use:
- Express.js 4.18.2+
- Node.js 14.0.0+

### Endpoints

Each service provides:
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /status` - Detailed status information
- `GET /` - Service information
- `GET /api/*` - Service-specific API endpoints

## Deployment

### ecosystem.config.js

All three services have been added to the PM2 ecosystem configuration:

```javascript
// PHASE 5: V-SUITE PRO SERVICES (Priority: MEDIUM)
{
  name: 'v-caster-pro',
  script: './services/v-caster-pro/server.js',
  port: 3501,
  // ... configuration
},
{
  name: 'v-prompter-pro',
  script: './services/v-prompter-pro/server.js',
  port: 3502,
  // ... configuration
},
{
  name: 'v-screen-pro',
  script: './services/v-screen-pro/server.js',
  port: 3503,
  // ... configuration
}
```

### Total Services

The ecosystem.config.js now includes **32 total services**:
- 29 original services
- 3 new V-Suite Pro services

### Deployment Scripts

**Quick Deploy V-Suite Pro Services**:
```bash
./deploy-v-suite-pro.sh
```

**Deploy All Services**:
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

**Deploy Only V-Suite Pro Services**:
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --only v-caster-pro,v-prompter-pro,v-screen-pro
```

## Testing Results

All three services have been tested and verified:

✅ **v-caster-pro**
- Service starts successfully
- Health endpoint returns valid JSON
- All features documented
- Error handling in place

✅ **v-prompter-pro**
- Service starts successfully
- Health endpoint returns valid JSON
- All features documented
- Error handling in place

✅ **v-screen-pro**
- Service starts successfully
- Health endpoint returns valid JSON
- All features documented
- Error handling in place

## Health Check Responses

### v-caster-pro
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "v-caster-pro",
  "port": "3501",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T15:12:48.038Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "features": ["casting", "broadcasting", "streaming", "recording"]
}
```

### v-prompter-pro
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "v-prompter-pro",
  "port": "3502",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T15:13:38.396Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "features": ["teleprompter", "script-management", "real-time-sync", "multi-device"]
}
```

### v-screen-pro
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "v-screen-pro",
  "port": "3503",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T15:14:06.531Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "features": ["screen-capture", "recording", "streaming", "annotations"]
}
```

## Integration Points

The V-Suite Pro services integrate with:

- **Media Processing Services**: For video encoding and transcoding
- **Streaming Services**: For live stream distribution
- **Content Management**: For storing and managing recordings
- **User Auth Services**: For access control and permissions

## Resource Requirements

Each service:
- **Memory**: 512MB max
- **CPU**: Standard Node.js requirements
- **Storage**: Depends on recording/caching needs

## Monitoring

Monitor services using PM2:

```bash
# View all services
pm2 list

# View specific service logs
pm2 logs v-caster-pro
pm2 logs v-prompter-pro
pm2 logs v-screen-pro

# Monitor resources
pm2 monit
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

1. Check if port is already in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3501  # or 3502, 3503
```

2. Check service logs:
```bash
pm2 logs v-caster-pro --lines 50
```

3. Restart service:
```bash
pm2 restart v-caster-pro
```

### Health Check Fails

1. Check if service is running:
```bash
pm2 list | grep v-caster-pro
```

2. Test endpoint manually:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3501/health
```

3. Check error logs:
```bash
pm2 logs v-caster-pro --err
```

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Deploy services to production environment
2. **Load Testing**: Test services under load
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure monitoring and alerting
4. **Integration Testing**: Test integration with other services
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation
6. **Security Review**: Conduct security audit

## Status

✅ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

All three services are implemented, tested, and ready for beta launch.
