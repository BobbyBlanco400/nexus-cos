## PASTE ALL TEXT BELOW

Create a 35-second cinematic animated video using the provided N3XUS v-COS logo, rendered as four stitched clips (9s + 9s + 9s + 8s) that form one continuous video with no visual cuts, no resets, and no audio dropouts.

The logo must remain visible for the entire duration and evolve smoothly across clips.

### 🔊 META AI AUDIO INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

*   Include continuous sound for the entire 35 seconds
*   Audio must start in Clip 1 and continue uninterrupted through Clip 4
*   Do NOT mute, reset, or restart audio between clips
*   Use ambient sci-fi system sound design
*   No silence at any point
*   No vocals, no music track, no beat drops
*   The sound should feel like a system powering on, stabilizing, and locking into an active state.

### 🔹 CLIP 1 — 9 seconds (SYSTEM EMERGENCE)

**Audio:**
A low, deep ambient hum fades in from near silence, like dormant power activating.
Very soft digital textures and distant data tones slowly appear.

**Visual:**
Black background with subtle digital particles.
The N3XUS v-COS logo slowly fades in and sharpens, revealing metallic depth.
Soft circuit-style light passes move across the logo.

*End the clip with motion still active so it can continue seamlessly.*

### 🔹 CLIP 2 — 9 seconds (SYSTEM ACTIVATION)

**Audio:**
The ambient hum grows fuller.
Light rhythmic pulses and soft digital ticks are added, still ambient and calm.
No beat, no rhythm reset.

**Visual:**
Energy lines flow horizontally and vertically through and around the logo.
Background particles increase slightly, resembling controlled digital rain.

*No camera cuts.*

### 🔹 CLIP 3 — 9 seconds (SYSTEM STABILITY)

**Audio:**
The sound smooths out and deepens.
High frequencies reduce slightly, leaving a confident, steady resonance.
Occasional faint synthetic sweeps pass through the soundscape.

**Visual:**
The logo appears locked in place, centered and stable.
Movement slows, emphasizing control and authority.
Subtle light sweeps highlight the text **“Virtual Creative Operating System.”**

### 🔹 CLIP 4 — 8 seconds (FINAL LOCK / LAUNCH STATE)

**Audio:**
A gentle low-frequency swell occurs near the beginning of this clip, then settles into a clean sustained tone.
Audio continues until the final frame with no fade-out gaps.

**Visual:**
The logo remains centered and fully illuminated.
Background motion slows to near stillness.
The video ends holding on the logo, suitable for looping.

### 🎨 STYLE RULES (META AI)

*   Futuristic, clean, cinematic
*   Dark background, cool metallic tones
*   Subtle neon highlights
*   No flashy effects
*   No sudden zooms
*   No distortion of the logo
*   Feels like a system boot sequence, not a commercial

### ✅ EXPECTED RESULT

Meta AI generates 4 stitched clips that:

1.  Play as one uninterrupted 35-second video
2.  Maintain continuous ambient sound
3.  Present a full N3XUS v-COS system activation
4.  End cleanly without silence or visual breaks

### ⚠️ META AI TIP (DO THIS IF ASKED TWICE)

If Meta AI shows a separate “Audio description” box, paste only this:

> “Continuous ambient sci-fi system sound plays for the entire 35-second video with no silence, no resets, and no cuts between clips.”
