# N3X-UP: The Cypher Dome™

**Phase 3 - Complete Competitive Battle Arena System**

## Overview

N3X-UP: The Cypher Dome™ is a persistent virtual battle arena featuring rap battles with hybrid AI + human + crowd judging, serialized IMVU-L league system, regional and style-based war maps, Belt NFT mechanics, and compliance-ready skill-based wagering.

## System Vision

**"You don't step in… you level up."**

N3X-UP represents a revolutionary battle system where:
- Battles are recorded permanently on the Neon Vault ledger
- Performance is judged by a hybrid AI + Crowd + Human system
- Progression follows a tiered ranking system from Initiate to Legacy
- Belts are earned as dynamic NFTs with real value and history
- Every bar, killshot, and moment is preserved as monetizable Echoes™
- Compliance-ready wagering allows skill-based competition
