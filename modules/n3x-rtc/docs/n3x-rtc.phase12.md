# N3X-RTC — Phase 12 Fabric Binding

Status: BOUND
Phase: 12
Binding Type: Declarative

n3x-rtc is now bound into the N3XUS Phase-12 Media Fabric.

This binding:
- Grants orchestration eligibility
- Enables fabric-level event propagation
- Extends UIC-E governance to media sessions
- Preserves P2P transport as the default runtime

Constraints:
- No centralized media relay
- No infrastructure declaration
- No persistence outside fabric policy

Runtime behavior remains Phase-11 unless explicitly elevated per-session.

This binding is additive and reversible by declaration only.
