# N3X-RTC — Phase 10 Canonical Primitive

N3X-RTC is introduced in Phase 10 as a signaling-only WebRTC governance primitive.

This module:
- Proves existence
- Enforces N3XUS LAW
- Compiles session decisions
- Emits audit provenance

It does NOT:
- Route media
- Host streams
- Claim infrastructure
- Replace Phase 11 runtime deliverables

All runtime expansion is explicitly deferred.
