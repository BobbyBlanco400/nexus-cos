# Nexus COS - Business & Domain Modules

This directory contains business and domain-specific modules that build on top of the core platform services.

## Module Architecture Overview

Each module contains:
- **Business Logic**: Domain-specific functionality
- **Microservices**: Specialized components for module features
- **Dependencies**: Clear mapping to required core services
- **Integration Points**: APIs and event handlers for communication

## Modules Structure

### Core Modules
- `core-os/` - Operating system core functionality
- `puabo-dsp/` - Digital Service Platform
- `puabo-blac/` - Business Loan and Credit services
- `v-suite/` - Video production tools suite
- `media-community/` - Community and social features
- `business-tools/` - Enterprise business utilities
- `integrations/` - Third-party service integrations

## Dependency Management

Each module includes a `deps.yaml` file that defines:
- Required core services
- Inter-module dependencies
- External integrations needed
- API contracts expected

## Module Relationships

Modules can depend on:
1. **Core Services** (from `/services/`)
2. **Other Modules** (peer dependencies)
3. **External Integrations** (third-party APIs)

## Getting Started

1. Review module-specific `README.md` files
2. Check `deps.yaml` for service requirements
3. Ensure required services are running before starting modules
4. Use provided scripts for automated deployment
