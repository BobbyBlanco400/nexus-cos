### Risk-Adjusted Return

**Expected Value Calculation:**

```
EV = (Conservative × 0.70) + (Base × 0.50) + (Optimistic × 0.20)

Year 5 Expected ROI:
= (37x × 0.70) + (100x × 0.50) + (210x × 0.20)
= 25.9x + 50x + 42x
= 117.9x

Expected 5-Year Return: ~118x on seed investment
```

**Comparable Company Valuations:**

- **DraftKings (DKNG):** $15B market cap, ~$3B revenue (5x multiple)
- **Flutter Entertainment (FLTR):** $24B market cap, ~$8B revenue (3x multiple)
- **Entain (ENT):** $10B market cap, ~$4B revenue (2.5x multiple)

**Casino Nexus Advantage:**
