- Conflict resolution: Newer files overwrite older ones (-Force flag)
- Problematic files: Skipped due to Windows path limitations

FINAL WORKSPACE:
================
Location: C:\temp\PUABO-OS-2025
Total repositories merged: 5 successful, 1 partial, 1 failed

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Install system dependencies
2. Setup backend services

6. Run validation tests

ISSUES TO MONITOR:
==================
- node-auth-api: Some files not available due to Windows path restrictions
- Missing PUABO-OS repository may affect some functionality
- File conflicts resolved by overwriting (newer files kept)
