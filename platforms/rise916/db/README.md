# Database Directory

This directory is a placeholder for database files and configurations for the Rise916 platform.

## Future Database Setup

When implementing the database:
1. Configure database connection settings
2. Create database schemas
3. Set up migrations
4. Implement seed data for artists, events, and community content

## Recommended Database

- PostgreSQL for relational data (artists, users, events)
- MongoDB for flexible content (stories, media metadata)
- Redis for caching and real-time features
