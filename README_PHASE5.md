## Canon Status

- Phases 1–4: Launched
- Phase 5: Enabled (Governed, Non-Conscious)
- Phases 6–9: Defined, Disabled

All synthetic entities are governed simulations.
No claims of consciousness or sentience are made.

How to run locally / in Codespaces

One command:

./bootstrap.sh

This will:
- Initialize Phase 5 (governance enforced)
- Confirm Phases 6–9 remain inert
- Exit non-zero if canonical verification fails
