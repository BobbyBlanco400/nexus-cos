# TRAE Solo Migration Guide for Nexus COS

## Migration Summary

This document outlines the complete migration of Nexus COS from traditional deployment to TRAE Solo orchestration.

## What Changed

### Before Migration
- Manual deployment scripts
- Individual service management
- Basic health monitoring
- Manual scaling and load balancing

### After Migration (TRAE Solo)
- Automated service orchestration
- Centralized configuration management
- Advanced health monitoring with auto-recovery
- Intelligent load balancing and SSL termination
- Container-ready deployment pipeline

## Key TRAE Solo Features Implemented

### 1. Service Orchestration
- **Multi-Service Coordination**: Node.js + Python backends, React frontend, PostgreSQL database
- **Dependency Management**: Services start in correct order based on dependencies
- **Health-Based Routing**: Traffic only routed to healthy service instances

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Centralized Config**: All environment variables in `.trae/environment.env`
- **Service Definitions**: Docker-compatible service specs in `.trae/services.yaml`
- **Main Orchestration**: Complete setup in `trae-solo.yaml`

### 3. Monitoring and Health Checks
- **Automatic Health Monitoring**: 30-second interval health checks
- **Auto-Recovery**: Failed services automatically restart
- **Prometheus Integration**: Metrics collection for monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format logs with retention policies

### 4. SSL and Security
- **Automatic SSL**: Let's Encrypt integration for domain certificates
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options automatically configured
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in DDoS protection

## Breaking Changes

### Environment Variables
- **New**: `DATABASE_URL` replaces individual DB connection vars
- **New**: `JWT_SECRET` for authentication security
- **Updated**: SSL configuration uses `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH`

### Service URLs
- **Node.js Backend**: Now accessible via `/api/node/` prefix
- **Python Backend**: Now accessible via `/api/python/` prefix
- **Health Checks**: Standardized across all services

### Deployment Process
- **Old**: Manual script execution in sequence
- **New**: Single command deployment with `./deploy-trae-solo.sh`
- **New**: NPM scripts for TRAE Solo operations

## Migration Steps Completed

1. ✅ **Configuration Setup**
   - Created `trae-solo.yaml` main configuration
   - Set up `.trae/` directory structure
   - Configured environment variables and service definitions

2. ✅ **Dependency Updates**
   - Updated `requirements.txt` with TRAE Solo compatible packages
   - Added monitoring and health check dependencies
   - Updated package.json files with TRAE Solo scripts

3. ✅ **Deployment Automation**
   - Created `deploy-trae-solo.sh` deployment script
   - Added NPM scripts for TRAE Solo operations
   - Configured automated health checking

4. ✅ **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README with TRAE Solo setup
   - Documented all new endpoints and configuration
   - Provided troubleshooting guides

## Developer Workflow Changes

### Before (Legacy)
```bash
# Start services manually
cd backend && npm start &
cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app &
cd frontend && npm run dev &
```

### After (TRAE Solo)
```bash
# Single command deployment
npm run trae:start

# Or use the deployment script
./deploy-trae-solo.sh
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Check all service status
npm run trae:status

# View aggregated logs
npm run trae:logs

# Health check all services
npm run trae:health

# Stop all services
npm run trae:stop
```

## Deployment Changes

### Legacy Deployment
1. Manual dependency installation
2. Individual service builds
3. Manual nginx configuration
4. Manual SSL certificate setup
5. Manual service monitoring

### TRAE Solo Deployment
1. Single configuration file (`trae-solo.yaml`)
2. Automated dependency installation
3. Orchestrated service deployment
4. Automatic SSL with Let's Encrypt
5. Built-in monitoring and auto-recovery

## Configuration Files Reference

### `trae-solo.yaml`
Main orchestration configuration with:
- Service definitions (Node.js, Python, Frontend, Database)
- Infrastructure setup (Nginx, SSL, Database)
- Deployment strategy and health checks
- Resource limits and monitoring

### `.trae/environment.env`
Environment variables for:
- Database connection settings
- Security configurations (JWT, encryption)
- Frontend API URLs
- SSL certificate paths
- Monitoring settings

### `.trae/services.yaml`
Docker-compatible service definitions with:
- Container images and versions
- Port mappings and networking
- Volume mounts and persistence
- Health check configurations
- Restart policies

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Common Migration Problems

1. **Service Won't Start**
   - Check `.trae/environment.env` for correct values
   - Verify service dependencies in `trae-solo.yaml`
   - Use `npm run trae:logs` to debug

2. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL service is running first
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` in environment config
   - Verify database initialization scripts

3. **SSL Certificate Issues**
   - Verify domain DNS points to server
   - Check `SSL_EMAIL` in environment config
   - Ensure ports 80/443 are open

4. **Health Check Failures**
   - Verify `/health` endpoints respond correctly
   - Check service startup time vs health check timeout
   - Review health check configuration in services

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Rollback to Legacy Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Stop TRAE Solo services
   npm run trae:stop
   
   # Use backup deployment scripts
   ./backup/deployment/deploy-complete.sh
   ```

2. **Reset TRAE Solo Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Restart all services
   npm run trae:stop
   npm run trae:start
   
   # Or full redeployment
   ./deploy-trae-solo.sh
   ```

## Performance Improvements

### Load Balancing
- Intelligent traffic distribution across service instances
- Health-based routing (no traffic to unhealthy services)
- SSL termination at load balancer level

### Resource Management
- Defined CPU and memory limits for each service
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Efficient resource utilization

### Monitoring Overhead
- Prometheus metrics collection with minimal performance impact
- Structured logging reduces I/O overhead
- Health checks optimized for low latency

## Security Enhancements

### TRAE Solo Security Features
- **Automatic SSL/TLS**: Let's Encrypt integration with auto-renewal
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Network Isolation**: Service-to-service communication controls
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variable encryption support

### Access Control
- Service-level access controls
- Database connection encryption
- API endpoint protection via load balancer

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Use TRAE Solo monitoring to track service performance
2. **Scale Services**: Configure auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backups with TRAE Solo
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Connect TRAE Solo deployment to CI/CD pipeline
