## 🚀 WHAT TO DO (3 STEPS)

### Step 1: Read Your Guide (10 minutes)
Open and read: **TRAE_SOLO_FINAL_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md**

It explains:
- What you're deploying
- How the deployment works
- What to do if something goes wrong
- How to verify success
- Daily operations commands

### Step 2: Execute Deployment (25 minutes)
SSH into your VPS and run this:

```bash
cd /opt && \
git clone https://github.com/BobbyBlanco400/nexus-cos.git && \
cd nexus-cos && \
bash EXECUTE_BETA_LAUNCH.sh
```

Then **wait**. The script does everything automatically.

### Step 3: Verify (5 minutes)
After deployment completes, verify:

```bash
# Check containers are running
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml ps

# Run health checks
bash pf-health-check.sh

# Test main endpoints
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

If all checks pass: **🎉 YOU'RE LIVE! 🎉**

## 💡 WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

### During Deployment

- **Don't interrupt** - Let it finish all 10 steps
- **Wait for services to start** - It takes 30-60 seconds after deployment

### After Deployment
- **Check TRAE_SOLO_FINAL_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md** - Has troubleshooting section
- **Check logs** - `docker compose logs -f service-name`
- **Restart service if needed** - `docker compose restart service-name`
