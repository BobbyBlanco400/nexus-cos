## 🔥 NEW: FIRST 5 VERIFIED BUILDERS PROGRAM

**LAUNCH:** Tomorrow Morning (Dec 27) at 7 AM  
**DURATION:** 5 Days (Dec 27-31)  
**STRUCTURE:** $100/day for 5 days = $500 total

### What Is It?

The first 5 verified builders who DM tomorrow morning get:
- Lower barrier: $100/day instead of $500 upfront
- Daily accountability: Payment + progress update required
- "Founding 5" designation (exclusive)
- Founder status (same as Genesis Pass)
- First access before regular Genesis Pass holders

### How It Works:

1. **Day 1 (Tomorrow):** First 5 to DM get verified → Pay $100 + share what they're building
2. **Days 2-5:** Same thing daily → $100 payment + progress update
3. **Complete 5 days:** Founder #1-5 status locked permanently
4. **Miss a day:** Position forfeited (strict accountability)

### Why This Matters:

- **Revenue:** $2,500 in 5 days (5 builders x $500)
- **Social Proof:** Daily updates create FOMO
- **Momentum:** Builds toward Genesis Pass sales
- **Community:** Early verification of builder quality

### Total Founder Positions:

- **First 5:** Founders #1-5 ($100/day x 5 days)
- **Genesis Pass:** Founders #6-25 ($500 one-time)
- **Total:** 25 Founding Creator positions
