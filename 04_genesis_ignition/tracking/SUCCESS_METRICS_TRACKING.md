## WHAT NOT TO TRACK

### Vanity Metrics (Ignore These):

- ❌ Total follower count
- ❌ Overall engagement rate
- ❌ Likes per post
- ❌ Comment volume
- ❌ Share counts (unless driving DMs)

**Why Ignore:**
- They don't correlate with conversions
- They create false success signals
- They waste optimization time
- They're spectator metrics, not builder metrics

**Only track metrics that directly impact the goal: $10,000 by Jan 1.**

---

## OPTIMIZATION TRIGGERS

### When to Adjust Strategy:

**IF conversion rate < 10%:**
- ✅ Tighten qualification questions
- ✅ Strengthen builder language
- ✅ Add more visual proof
- ✅ Increase authority tone

**IF DM volume low:**
- ✅ Post more content
- ✅ Adjust posting times
- ✅ Increase social reach
- ✅ Test new platforms

**IF qualified leads not converting:**
- ✅ Shorten DM conversations
- ✅ Simplify payment process
- ✅ Add urgency (without hype)
- ✅ Show more infrastructure proof

**IF running behind pace:**
- ✅ Post final countdown content
- ✅ Emphasize finality harder
- ✅ Increase posting frequency
- ✅ DO NOT: discount or extend deadline
