# OPERATION GENESIS IGNITION - QUICK REFERENCE CARD

**DEADLINE:** 01/01/2026 @ 11:59 PM  
**TARGET:** $10,000 (20 x $500)  
**STATUS:** ✅ READY TO EXECUTE

---

## ONE-PAGE SUMMARY

### THE MISSION
Sell 20 Founding Creator Genesis Passes at $500 each to fund THIIO Developer infrastructure ($497/month) before public launch. Close permanently on January 1st, 2026. No reopening. Ever.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **SILENCE** - Never explain what Nexus COS does
2. **FINALITY** - No reopening after Jan 1
3. **AUTHORITY** - Inform, don't convince
4. **BUILDERS ONLY** - Filter out spectators
5. **INFRASTRUCTURE** - Show costs, not revenue

---

## CONTENT SYSTEM

### Daily Posts:
- **1 Video** (45-60s) on TikTok/Instagram/Facebook
- **2-3 Stories** on Instagram/Facebook
- **All captions** reinforce finality

### Key Messages:
- "Founders exist before attention"
- "Genesis Pass: $500, 20 positions, closes 01/01/2026"
- "No relaunch. No exceptions."
- "DM if you're building"

---

## DM CONVERSION (3-5 MESSAGES MAX)

### Message 1 (Their Inquiry):
```
"Genesis Pass is founder access to Nexus COS before public launch.
$500 one-time. 20 positions total. Closes 01/01/2026.

Quick question: Are you currently building something, or exploring opportunities?"
```

### Message 2 (If Builder):
```
"Perfect. Genesis Pass gets you founder status: early access, 
infrastructure positioning, and permanent founder credit when we 
launch publicly in Q1 2026.

Infrastructure is being built now with THIIO Developers ($497/month real costs).

Does this structure make sense for where you are?"
```

### Message 3 (Close):
```
"Perfect. Payment via [LINK].

Once received:
1. You get Genesis Pass confirmation
2. You're locked as Founder #[X] of 20
3. Full platform access sends Q1 2026

$500 one-time. No recurring charges."
```

### If They Need "More Info":
```
"I get it. Genesis Pass isn't for everyone.

If you need feature lists, demos, or traction proof, 
Genesis Pass isn't the right fit.

Public launch in Q1 2026 will have all of that - but no founder access.

Your call."
```

**Then STOP. Don't chase.**
