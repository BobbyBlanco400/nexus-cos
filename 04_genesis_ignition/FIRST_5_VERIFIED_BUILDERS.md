# FIRST 5 VERIFIED BUILDERS - EARLY ACCESS PROGRAM

**PRIORITY:** MAXIMUM - IMMEDIATE LAUNCH  
**START DATE:** Tomorrow Morning (Dec 27, 2025)  
**DURATION:** 5 Days (Dec 27 - Dec 31)  
**TARGET:** $500.00 per builder = $2,500 total in 5 days

---

## PROGRAM OVERVIEW

**Mission:** Reward the first 5 verified builders who DM daily with an exclusive early access opportunity that generates $500 in 5 days.

**Structure:**
- First 5 people to DM tomorrow morning
- Must be verified as legitimate builders
- Must commit to daily check-ins
- Receive special early founder positioning
- Pay $100/day for 5 days = $500 total

**Why This Works:**
- Lower barrier to entry ($100/day vs $500 upfront)
- Daily commitment = verification of seriousness
- Scarcity (only 5 spots)
- Urgency (starting tomorrow)
- Creates FOMO for regular Genesis Pass

---

## OFFER STRUCTURE

### Option A: Daily Payment Plan (5 Days)

**Price:** $100 per day for 5 days = $500 total

**Payment Schedule:**
- Day 1 (Dec 27): $100
- Day 2 (Dec 28): $100
- Day 3 (Dec 29): $100
- Day 4 (Dec 30): $100
- Day 5 (Dec 31): $100

**Total:** $500 (same as Genesis Pass)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Lower daily commitment
- ✅ Founder status (same as Genesis Pass)
- ✅ "First 5" designation (exclusive)
- ✅ Daily accountability check-ins
- ✅ Early access before regular Genesis Pass holders

**Verification:**
- Must DM daily with progress update
- Miss a day = forfeit position
- Must complete all 5 payments to lock founder status

---

### Option B: Immediate $500 with Daily Check-In Bonus

**Price:** $500 one-time (same as Genesis Pass)

**Structure:**
- Pay $500 immediately tomorrow morning
- Check in daily for 5 days
- Complete all 5 check-ins = receive bonus

**Bonus Options:**
1. $100 credit toward future platform features
2. Exclusive "Founding 5" badge
3. Direct access to founder group chat
4. First access to Q1 platform (before other 20)

**Verification:**

- Share what you're building
- Miss a check-in = no bonus (but keep founder status)

---

## RECOMMENDED: OPTION A (DAILY PAYMENT PLAN)

**Why Daily Payments Work Better:**

1. **Lower Barrier** - $100 is easier to commit than $500
2. **Verification Built-In** - Daily payment = daily verification
3. **Filters Serious Builders** - Only committed people complete 5 days
4. **Creates Momentum** - Daily engagement builds community
5. **FOMO Generator** - Others see daily activity, want Genesis Pass

**Psychology:**
- Day 1: "I can afford $100"
- Day 2: "I'm 20% in, let's continue"
- Day 3: "Halfway there, can't quit now"
- Day 4: "Almost done, finish strong"
- Day 5: "Complete! Founder status locked."

## INTEGRATION WITH GENESIS PASS

### Relationship:

**First 5 Verified Builders:**
- Pay $500 over 5 days ($100/day)
- Daily accountability required
- "Founding 5" designation
- Founders #1-5

**Genesis Pass (Regular):**
- Pay $500 one-time
- No daily check-ins required
- Standard founder status
- Founders #6-25 (20 total)

**Total Founders:** 5 (First 5) + 20 (Genesis Pass) = 25 total

---

## SOCIAL PROOF & FOMO

### Post Daily Updates:

**Day 1:**
```
First 5 Verified Builders Program launched.

[X]/5 spots filled.

$100/day for 5 days starts today.

DM if you're building.
```

**Day 2:**
```
First 5 Program: Day 2.

All [X] builders checked in.
All payments received.

This is what commitment looks like.

Genesis Pass still available: $500 one-time.
```

**Day 3-5:**
[Similar updates showing progress]

### After Program Complete:

**Story/Post:**
```
First 5 Verified Builders Program: COMPLETE.

5 builders. 5 days. $100/day.

They're now Founding 5.

Genesis Pass (Founders #6-25): $500, closes 01/01/2026.

DM if you're building.
```

**This creates massive FOMO for Genesis Pass.**

---

## REVENUE BREAKDOWN

### First 5 Program:
- 5 builders x $500 = $2,500
- Timeline: 5 days (Dec 27-31)
- Daily revenue: $500/day

### Genesis Pass (Remaining):
- 20 positions x $500 = $10,000
- Timeline: Dec 26 - Jan 1
- Combined with First 5 momentum

### Total Potential:
- **$12,500** (25 total founders)
- First 5: $2,500 (Dec 27-31)
- Genesis Pass: $10,000 (Dec 26 - Jan 1)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: People Don't Complete 5 Days

**Mitigation:**
- Only accept VERIFIED builders (serious people)
- $100/day is low enough to complete
- Daily check-in = accountability
- Forfeit = open spot to next person

### Risk: Not Enough DMs Tomorrow

**Mitigation:**
- Announce today (tonight)
- Post countdown tonight
- "Starting tomorrow at 7 AM"
- Create urgency and anticipation

### Risk: Payment Processing Issues

**Mitigation:**
- Use Stripe recurring payment
- Or manual daily invoices
- Have backup PayPal ready
