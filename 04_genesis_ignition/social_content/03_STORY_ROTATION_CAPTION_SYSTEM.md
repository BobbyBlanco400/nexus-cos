---

## STORY TEXT TEMPLATES

### Category 1: Authority Statements

**Story 1:**
```
Founders don't need convincing.

They recognize the moment.

Genesis Pass: 20 positions
Closes 01/01/2026
```

**Story 2:**
```
We're not explaining.
We're not proving.
We're not convincing.

Builders know.
Spectators scroll.

Genesis Pass: $500
```

**Story 3:**
```
Infrastructure costs money.
THIIO Developers: $497/month.

Founders fund before launch.
Users pay after.

Simple.
```

**Story 4:**
```
After January 1st:
No Genesis Pass.
No founder access.
No early position.

This isn't scarcity marketing.
This is finality.
```

**Story 5:**
```
Spotify had founders.
Netflix had founders.
Uber had founders.

They got equity.
Users got subscriptions.

Nexus COS has 20 founder positions.
That's it.
```

### Category 2: Countdown Mechanics

**Story 6 (Use after Dec 28):**
```
Less than 4 days.

Genesis Pass closes 01/01/2026.

After that: History.
```

**Story 7 (Use Dec 30):**
```
48 hours.

Then the cutline is drawn.

Founders: Before the line.
Users: After the line.

Permanent.
```

**Story 8 (Use Dec 31):**
```
Final 24 hours.

Genesis Pass closes tonight at 11:59 PM.

No relaunch.
No extensions.
No exceptions.
```

**Story 9 (Use Jan 1, morning):**
```
Final hours.

Genesis closes tonight.

DM if you're building.

This is it.
```

---

### Category 3: Pattern Interruption

**Story 10:**
```
We could explain what Nexus COS does.

We won't.

Builders recognize infrastructure.
Spectators need demos.

Which are you?
```

**Story 11:**
```
"Show me proof."
"Convince me."
"What's the ROI?"

If these are your first questions,
Genesis Pass isn't for you.

And that's okay.
```

**Story 12:**
```
Every platform has a before moment.

Before visibility.
Before traction.
Before everyone knows.

This is that moment.

After January 1st, it's gone.
```

**Story 13:**
```
Silence is strategy.

We're not launching with fanfare.
We're not convincing anyone.
We're funding infrastructure quietly.

Founders understand this.
```

---

### Category 4: Finality Reinforcement

**Story 14:**
```
"Will you do another round?"

No.

"Will you extend the deadline?"

No.

"Will you reopen Genesis Pass?"

No.

Finality is the point.
```

**Story 15:**
```
Genesis Pass:
Opens: Now
Closes: 01/01/2026
Reopens: Never

This is what makes it matter.
```

**Story 16:**
```
20 positions.
$500 each.
One time payment.

After January 1st:
These positions cease to exist.

Literally.
```

---

### Category 5: Self-Selection

**Story 17:**
```
If you're waiting for:
- A launch page
- Feature explanations
- Testimonials
- Public traction

This isn't for you.

Founders move before proof.
```

**Story 18:**
```
"Why should I trust this?"

You shouldn't.

Trust isn't what founders optimize for.

Pattern recognition is.
```

**Story 19:**
```
Builders see:
"$497/month for THIIO devs"

And think:
"That's how infrastructure gets funded."

Spectators see the same thing.
And think:
"Prove it to me."

Genesis Pass is for builders.
```

## ENGAGEMENT RULES

### DO:
- ✅ Respond to genuine builder inquiries via DM
- ✅ Keep responses short and authoritative
- ✅ Filter out non-builders quickly
- ✅ Track conversion from comment to DM

### DON'T:
- ❌ Engage with skeptics in comments
- ❌ Explain features publicly
- ❌ Defend the price
- ❌ Try to convince non-believers
- ❌ Get defensive or emotional

---

## MEASUREMENT & OPTIMIZATION

### Track Daily:
1. Story views
2. Story replies
3. DM volume
4. DM quality (builder vs. spectator)
5. Conversion rate (DM to payment)

### Optimize For:
- **Higher quality DMs** (not just volume)
- **Self-filtering language** (reduce time waste)
- **Authority reinforcement** (increase trust)
- **Finality emphasis** (increase urgency)

### Do NOT Optimize For:
- ❌ Likes or comments (vanity metrics)
- ❌ Follower count (we want quality, not quantity)
- ❌ Engagement rate (we want conversions, not engagement)

## FINAL NOTES

- Silence is powerful
- Repetition without dilution
- Finality is the message
- Authority over explanation
- Builders over spectators

**Every caption, every story, every word reinforces:**

> "This is real. This is permanent. This is finite. If you're building, you understand. If not, that's okay."
