## VIDEO 1: THE COST OF BUILDING

### Script

**[Screen shows blurred receipt/invoice]**

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "This is what it costs to build infrastructure before attention."

**SPEAKER (voiceover, calm):**

"THIIO Developers. $497 per month.

That's real code. Real infrastructure. Real developers building while everyone else is talking.

Founders fund this before there's visibility.

After January 1st, this opportunity doesn't exist."

**[Hold on blurred Stripe dashboard - no numbers visible]**

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "Genesis Pass: 20 positions
> 
> Closes 01/01/2026"

**[End.]**

### Caption
```
Real infrastructure costs real money.

Founders fund before attention.
Users pay after launch.

Genesis Pass closes 01/01/2026.

DM if you're building.
```

## VIDEO 2: SILENCE AS STRATEGY

### Script

**[Black screen. No voice. Just text slowly appearing.]**

**TEXT:**
> "We won't explain the features.
> 
> We won't show you the roadmap.
> 
> We won't prove this will work.
> 
> Because founders don't need convincing.
> 
> They recognize the moment."

**[Pause. 5 seconds.]**

**TEXT:**
> "Genesis Pass: $500
> 
> 20 positions
> 
> Closes 01/01/2026
> 
> DM if you're building."

**[Hold. End.]**

### Caption
```
If you need convincing, you're not a founder.

If you need proof, you're not early.

If you need explanations, it's not for you.

Genesis Pass: 20 positions. Closes 01/01/2026.
```

## VIDEO 3: THE CUTLINE

### Script

**SPEAKER (direct to camera, calm):**

"There's a line in every platform's history.

Before the line: founders.

After the line: users.

The difference is permanent.

Spotify. Netflix. Uber. Airbnb.

The founders got equity. The users paid monthly.

Nexus COS has 20 founder positions left.

After January 1st, the line is drawn.

Forever."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "Founders: Before the line
> 
> Users: After the line
> 
> Genesis closes 01/01/2026"

**[End.]**

### Caption
```
Every platform has a cutline moment.

Before: Founders
After: Users

Genesis Pass is the cutline for Nexus COS.

20 positions. $500. Closes 01/01/2026.

DM if you're building.
```

## VIDEO 4: NO RELAUNCH

### Script

**[Screen recording: Typing and deleting text]**

**TEXT APPEARING AND BEING DELETED:**
> "What if we did a second round after January?"
> 
> [DELETED]
> 
> "What if we opened more spots?"
> 
> [DELETED]
> 
> "What if we extended the deadline?"
> 
> [DELETED]

**SPEAKER (voiceover):**

"No.

Genesis closes January 1st.

No second round.
No extensions.
No reopening.

This is why it matters.

This is why 20 founders will have something no one else can get."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "Closes 01/01/2026
> 
> Never reopens."

**[End.]**

### Caption
```
No relaunch.
No second round.
No extensions.

When Genesis closes, it's permanent.

This is why founder status matters.

20 positions. $500. Closes 01/01/2026.
```

## VIDEO 5: BEFORE ATTENTION

### Script

**SPEAKER (calm, philosophical):**

"Right now, no one knows what Nexus COS is.

No articles.
No press.
No influencers.

Just infrastructure being built in silence.

This is the before moment.

After January 1st, we go public.

But founders exist before attention.

Not after."

**[Pause.]**

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "Before: Founders only
> 
> After: Everyone else
> 
> Choose."

**[End.]**

### Caption
```
Founders exist before attention.

After attention comes visibility.
After visibility comes users.

But founders are defined by being first.

Genesis Pass: Before attention ends 01/01/2026.

DM if you're building.
```

## VIDEO 6: THE BUILDER TEST

### Script

**SPEAKER (direct):**

"Here's how you know if Genesis Pass is for you:

When you hear '$500 one-time for founder access,' does your first thought go to:

'What's the ROI?'
'What do I get?'
'Prove it to me?'

Or does it go to:

'That's how infrastructure gets funded before launch.'

Builders recognize the pattern.

Spectators need convincing.

Genesis Pass is for builders."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "Builders recognize.
> 
> Spectators need proof.
> 
> Which are you?"

**[End.]**

### Caption
```
The builder test:

Do you recognize infrastructure funding?
Or do you need convincing?

Genesis Pass is for those who see it.

20 positions. $500. Closes 01/01/2026.
```

## VIDEO 7: FINAL COUNTDOWN (Post Dec 30)

### Script

**[Screen shows calendar/clock visual]**

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "January 1, 2026
> 
> 11:59 PM
> 
> Genesis Pass closes permanently."

**SPEAKER (calm, final):**

"Less than 48 hours.

After this, there's no founder access.
No early position.
No getting in before public launch.

20 positions were available.

How many are left right now, I don't know.

But I know January 1st at midnight, this opportunity becomes history.

Literally."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
> "Closes in <X> hours
> 
> No relaunch. Ever."

**[End.]**

### Caption
```
Final hours.

Genesis Pass closes 01/01/2026 at 11:59 PM.

After that: History.

No relaunch.
No exceptions.
No second chances.

DM if you're building.
```
