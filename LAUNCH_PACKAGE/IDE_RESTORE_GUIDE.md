# IDE Task Import & Restoration Guide

Here is the detailed solution to use the **Import** option effectively when resuming work or starting a new session:

## 🎯 The Import Option Appears When Starting a NEW Task
The "Pull from GitHub" / Import option is designed to show up when you start a fresh task, not within an existing conversation.

## What to Do:

1.  **Start a New Task**
    *   Click `+ New Chat` or `New Task` (typically found in the sidebar or at the top of the screen).

2.  **Before Typing Anything**
    *   Look for the **GitHub button** at the bottom.
    *   Click it **BEFORE** entering any prompt.

3.  **Select Your Repository**
    *   Choose from your list of GitHub repositories.
    *   Click on **"N3XUS-vCOS"** to import.

4.  **Continue Development**
    *   Your files will be restored.
    *   You can resume from where you left off.
