### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"Service Unavailable" / Loading Spinner?**
- Don't panic. We are in Beta.
- Hard Refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac).
- If the issue persists, check the **#status** channel in Discord.

**"Connection Not Private"?**
- You are accessing via **HTTP (Port 8080)**. This is normal for the Beta Launch. Your data is secure within our internal container network. We will enable full SSL Encryption in the "Gamma" release phase.
