## Objective
Diagnose why the SVG logo is not displaying correctly in the Expo web preview by using browser developer tools to inspect the SVG element and report findings.

---

## Steps to Perform

1. **Open the Web Preview**
   - Ensure the Expo app is running.
   - Go to http://localhost:8081 in your browser.

2. **Open Developer Tools**
   - Windows/Linux: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
   - Mac: Press `Cmd+Option+I`
   - OR: Right-click anywhere on the page and select **"Inspect"**.

3. **Locate the SVG Element**
   - In the "Elements" or "Inspector" tab, search for `<svg>` (typically with `Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F`).
   - Confirm if the SVG element for the logo is present in the DOM.

4. **Examine Computed Styles**
   - Click on the `<svg>` element.
   - In the "Styles" or "Computed" panel, check:
     - `width`
     - `height`
     - `display`
     - `visibility`
     - `opacity`
     - `transform`
   - Verify that:
     - `display` is not `none`
     - `visibility` is not `hidden`
     - `opacity` is not `0`
     - `width` and `height` are as expected (not zero)

5. **Check Browser Console**
   - Click the **Console** tab in Developer Tools.
   - Look for any errors or warnings related to SVG, images, or components (red/yellow messages).

6. **Document Your Findings**
   - Note if the `<svg>` is present and its styles.
   - Copy any relevant console errors or warnings.
   - Take a screenshot of the SVG and its computed styles if possible.

7. **Report Back**
   - Summarize:
     - Is the SVG in the DOM?
     - What are its computed styles?
     - Any console errors/warnings?
   - Attach screenshots or console output if available.

## Why This Matters
Your inspection will help determine whether the SVG is being blocked by CSS, is invisible, or if there is a deeper rendering issueâ€”crucial for finding the right solution.

**Please complete this inspection and report your findings before any further development or troubleshooting.**
