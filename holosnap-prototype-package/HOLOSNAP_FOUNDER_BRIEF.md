## 🔐 Critical Requirements

### 1. Device Identity Programming

**CRITICAL:** Each HoloSnap unit must have a **unique device ID** programmed during assembly.

**Format:** `HSNAP-[WAVE]-[SERIAL]`  
**Examples:**
- `HSNAP-W1-FTR-001` (Wave 1, Founder Tenant Rights holder #1)
- `HSNAP-W2-CRT-015` (Wave 2, Creator pre-order #15)

**Programming Method:**
- Flash device ID to EEPROM during firmware stub loading
- Include device ID in firmware metadata
- Ensure ID is immutable after programming

### 2. Inactive State Shipping

**CRITICAL:** All devices must ship in **inactive state**.

**Reason:** HoloSnap devices activate via **MetaTwin handshake** upon first user boot. This ensures:
- Canonical identity verification (Handshake 55-45-17)
- Tenant-aware activation (linked to pre-order ledger)
- Security and access control
- Lifecycle tracking from activation

**What This Means:**
- Firmware stub is pre-loaded but not fully activated
- Device powers on but displays "Awaiting Activation"
- Full functionality unlocks only after N3XUS authorizes

### 3. Quality Assurance Standards

**CRITICAL:** 98%+ pass rate target.

**Testing Requirements:**
- Power-on self-test (POST) — 100% units
- Battery charging verification — 100% units
- Wireless connectivity range test — Sample basis (10%)
- Sensor calibration check — 100% units
- Firmware stub validation — 100% units

**Rework Process:**
- Any unit failing QA must be reworked or replaced
- Document all failures and resolutions
- Re-test after rework

## 💰 Economic Context

### NexCoin Closed-Loop Economy

N3XUS v-COS operates a **closed-loop economy** with **NexCoin** as the sovereign currency.

**Key Points:**
- Users purchase NexCoin (1,000 NexCoin = $250 USD)
- All ecosystem transactions use NexCoin (non-cashable)
- HoloSnap pre-orders paid in NexCoin only

**Wave 2 Pricing:** 2,000 NexCoin (~$500 USD value)

**Why This Matters:**
- Manufacturing costs covered by N3XUS (not end users)
- You'll be paid in USD directly by N3XUS
- Simplifies international payments and compliance

## 🤝 Partnership Philosophy

### Canon First, Manufacturing Second, Activation Last

**N3XUS Philosophy:**
> *"The device exists canonically before it exists physically."*

**What This Means:**
1. **Canon First:** Device designed in N3XUS v-COS (digital twin created)
2. **Manufacturing Second:** Seeed Studio executes physical production
3. **Activation Last:** Device activates via MetaTwin handshake on first boot

**Partnership Model:**
```
N3XUS COS (Design Authority)
     ↓ Specifications
Seeed Studio (Manufacturing)
     ↓ Completed Units
End Users (Activation)
```

**You Handle:** Manufacturing excellence  
**We Handle:** Identity, activation, ecosystem integration
