3. Incremental commits (fewer large documentation dumps)

### Key Takeaways
1. **Documentation is critical** - Future operators need context
2. **Governance works** - Technical freeze maintains stability
3. **Verification scripts are valuable** - Automated checks save time
4. **Clear milestones matter** - Phase seal provides closure
5. **History is important** - Timeline helps understand decisions
