## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: Service won't start
```bash
# Solution 1: Check logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml logs service-name

# Solution 2: Rebuild
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d --build service-name

# Solution 3: Restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml restart service-name
```

### Issue: Database connection failed
```bash
# Solution 1: Restart PostgreSQL
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml restart nexus-cos-postgres

# Solution 2: Check if running
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml ps nexus-cos-postgres

# Solution 3: Test connection
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml exec nexus-cos-postgres \
  psql -U nexus_user -d nexus_db -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Issue: Port conflict
```bash
# Find what's using the port
sudo lsof -i :3001

# Kill the process
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Or change port in docker-compose.unified.yml
```
