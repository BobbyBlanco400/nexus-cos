# What is NexCoin?

NexCoin is the official platform credit for the Nexus COS ecosystem.

Users purchase NexCoin packages and use NexCoin to access games, premium casino experiences, VR lounges, and creator-powered features across the platform.

NexCoin is used entirely within Nexus COS and unlocks experiences, entertainment, and digital access — it is not a cryptocurrency and cannot be withdrawn for cash.
