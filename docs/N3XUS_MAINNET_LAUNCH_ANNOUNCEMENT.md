## 🚀 MAINNET ACTIVATED

Today marks the official launch of **N3XUS COS** — the world's first **Creative Operating System**.

This is not a platform.  
This is not a service.  
This is not a network.

**This is an Operating System for Creators.**

---

## What is a Creative Operating System?

N3XUS COS is the first infrastructure-grade system designed to deploy, operate, and scale **independent creator platforms** as sovereign mini-applications.

Every creator becomes their own platform.  
Every platform is isolated, verified, and autonomous.  
Every deployment is deterministic, compliant, and instantly scalable.

**One OS. Infinite Creators.**
