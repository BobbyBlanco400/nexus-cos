Nexus COS Frontend Transformation — OTT/Streaming Platform

Overview
- Rebranded the frontend to represent Nexus COS as an OTT/Streaming TV platform. Club Saditty is now correctly positioned as one module within the ecosystem.

Problem
- The frontend was titled and structured as “Club Saditty Lobby” with club-specific sections (Lobby, Main Stage, VIP Suites, Dressing Rooms, Office), misrepresenting the broader platform.

Solution
- Converted the UI and copy to showcase Nexus COS as a complete streaming platform with a clear modules hierarchy. Club Saditty remains available, but as one module among many.

Changes Made
- Header & Branding
  - Title changed to “🚀 Nexus COS — OTT/Streaming Platform”.
  - Loading screen updated to “Loading Nexus COS Platform…”.
  - Footer now: “🚀 Nexus COS — Complete Operating System | OTT/Streaming TV Platform with Integrated Modules”.

- Navigation
  - Replaced club-specific areas with platform sections:
    - 🏠 Home
    - 📺 Live TV
    - 🎬 On Demand
    - 🎯 Modules
    - ⚙️ Settings

- Platform Features
  - Live TV grid showing live/offline status.
  - On-Demand catalog for VOD content.
  - Modules page showcasing:
    - 🎨 Creator Hub

    - 🌐 PuaboVerse
    - 🎪 Club Saditty (as a module)
    - 🎥 V-Screen Hollywood
    - 📊 Analytics

- Statistics Dashboard
  - Replaced club metrics with platform metrics:
    - Active Viewers (streaming metric)
    - Live Channels (OTT/IPTV)
    - Available Modules (ecosystem size)
    - On-Demand Content (library size)

- Subscription Tiers

    - 🎥 Studio ($49.99/month)
