## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

### Audio Processing
1. **EQ**: Slight high-pass filter (remove rumble below 80Hz)
2. **Compression**: Light (3:1 ratio, -3dB threshold)
3. **De-Esser**: Reduce harsh "S" sounds
4. **Reverb**: Very subtle (5-10% wet) — "studio" preset
5. **Limiting**: -1dB ceiling (ensure no clipping)

### Timing Adjustments
- Stretch/compress delivery to match on-screen text timing
- Use time-stretching if needed (subtle — no pitch shift)
- Ensure all VO ends before 00:45 mark

### Background Music
- Music bed should sit **under** VO, not compete
- Duck music -6dB during VO sections
- Bring music up between VO lines
- Final mix: VO at -6dB, music at -18dB
