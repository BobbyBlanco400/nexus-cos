**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Critical Review Required
**Priority**: Immediate Action Required

## 1. Current System State

### Infrastructure Overview
```yaml
vps_server:
  ip: 74.208.155.161
  status: Not Responding
  domains:
    - nexuscos.online
    - beta.nexuscos.online
  dns_resolution: ✅ Successful
  connectivity: ❌ Failed
```

### Service Matrix
| Service | Port | Status | Priority |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| Backend API | 3001 | ❌ Offline | Critical |
| AI Service | 3010 | ❌ Offline | Critical |
| Key Service | 3014 | ❌ Offline | Critical |
| Grafana | 3000 | ❌ Offline | High |
| Prometheus | 9090 | ❌ Offline | High |

## 2. Critical Findings

### A. Network Layer
1. **VPS Connectivity**
   - DNS resolves correctly to 74.208.155.161
   - 100% packet loss to VPS
   - No response on any service ports
   - Potential firewall or network isolation

2. **CDN Layer**
   - CloudFlare configuration active
   - Full (Strict) mode enabled
   - Unable to verify edge connectivity
   - Cache configuration present but untested

### B. Service Layer
1. **Core Services**
   - PM2 process manager installed but no active processes
   - All critical services offline
   - Health check endpoints unreachable
   - Service dependencies unverified

2. **SSL/Security**
   - Certificates properly configured in VPS
   - Unable to verify live SSL status
   - Security headers not accessible
   - TLS handshake failing

## 3. Required Fixes

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
```yaml
network_restoration:
  steps:
    1. VPS Access Verification:
       - SSH connectivity check
       - Firewall rules audit
       - Network interface status
       - Route table verification
    
    2. Service Restoration:
       - PM2 process recovery
       - Service dependency check
       - Log analysis
       - Health endpoint verification

    3. SSL Verification:
       - Certificate path validation
       - Permission verification
       - Nginx SSL configuration check
       - TLS handshake test
```

### Secondary Actions (Priority 2)
```yaml
monitoring_setup:
  components:
    - Grafana deployment
    - Prometheus configuration
    - Alert rules setup
    - Log aggregation

security_hardening:
  tasks:
    - Header configuration
    - Rate limiting setup
    - WAF rules verification
    - Access control audit
```

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Network Recovery
1. **VPS Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Required Commands
   ssh root@74.208.155.161
   iptables -L
   netstat -tulpn
   systemctl status nginx
   ```

2. **Service Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Service Restoration
   cd /opt/nexus-cos
   pm2 start all
   systemctl start nginx
   ```

3. **SSL Verification**
   ```bash
   # Certificate Verification
   openssl verify /etc/ssl/ionos/fullchain.pem
   nginx -t
   systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### Phase 2: Service Deployment
1. **Core Services**
   ```yaml
   deployment_order:
     1. Backend API (3001)
     2. Key Service (3014)
     3. AI Service (3010)
     4. Monitoring Stack
   ```

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   ```yaml
   monitoring_components:
     - Grafana (3000)
     - Prometheus (9090)
     - Node Exporter
     - Alert Manager
   ```

## 5. Verification Checklist

### Network Layer
- [ ] VPS ping successful
- [ ] SSH access restored
- [ ] Firewall rules verified
- [ ] DNS propagation complete

### Service Layer
- [ ] PM2 processes running
- [ ] Nginx serving traffic
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Logs showing normal activity

### Security Layer
- [ ] SSL handshake successful
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] CloudFlare proxying active
- [ ] Access controls working

## 6. Required Resources

### Access Requirements
```yaml
credentials_needed:
  - VPS root access
  - CloudFlare API tokens
  - SSL certificate files
  - PM2 deployment keys
```

### Tools Required
```yaml
diagnostic_tools:
  - SSH client
  - OpenSSL
  - Nginx
  - PM2
  - Network utilities
```

## 7. Success Metrics

### Primary Indicators
- All domains responding to HTTPS
- Services running with PM2
- SSL certificates valid
- Health checks passing

### Secondary Indicators
