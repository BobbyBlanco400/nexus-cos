Nexus COS Platform — Official Launch Report

Summary
The Nexus COS Platform (PF) has reached launch readiness and is deployed behind Nginx with SSL, orchestrated via Ansible on a VPS. This report documents the release scope, infrastructure, validation, risks, and operating plan for Day 0–30.

Release Details
- Version: PF v1.2 (baseline), automation enriched in v2025.10
- Launch window: October 12, 2025, 15:41 PST (legal timestamp recorded)
- Primary domain: https://nexuscos.online
- Beta domain: https://beta.nexuscos.online
- Environment: Single VPS (74.208.155.161), Ubuntu/Debian compatible
- Reverse proxy: Nginx with Certbot (Let’s Encrypt) automation
- Orchestration: Ansible (idempotent), Docker runtime
- Repo path: artifacts/pf-ansible

Scope of Launch
- Public site and PF web delivery via Nginx
- Core PF backend/API (Docker services)
- Health checks and basic monitoring endpoints (PF_INDEX.md)
- SSL certificates and HTTP→HTTPS redirects
- Baseline security hardening (packages, firewall, least-privileged runtime)

Architecture Overview
- Pattern: Ubuntu/Debian + Docker + Nginx + Certbot
- Automation: Ansible playbook (playbook.yml) installs Docker, configures Nginx, provisions TLS, deploys PF services, and runs health checks.
- Domains: apex and beta routed to Nginx; PF services proxied to containers.
- Certs: Issued via Certbot (nginx plugin) with auto-renewal.

Deployment Summary
1) Control machine prepared with Ansible.
2) Inventory set to `ansible_user=ubuntu` by default (Debian supported).
3) Playbook executed from `artifacts/pf-ansible/` against VPS.
4) Docker services launched; Nginx fronted; TLS issued.
5) Post-deploy checks completed.

Validation & Health Checks
- Nginx responds: 200 at `/` and configured subpaths.
- PF services healthy: see PF_INDEX.md for endpoints.
- TLS valid: Let’s Encrypt cert chains present; redirects enforced.
- Logs clean: Nginx, Docker, PF services show no critical errors.

Security Posture
- SSL/TLS enforced with HSTS and redirect to HTTPS.
- Packages kept current; Docker from official repos.
- SSH: Key-based auth, non-root user (`ubuntu` or `debian`), firewall recommended.
- Nginx: Minimal exposure; only required ports open (80/443).

Risks & Mitigations
- DNS propagation delays → schedule launch window; pre-validate DNS.
- Certificate issuance rate limits → coordinate domain requests; use staging if needed.
- Single VPS SPOF → plan scale-out path; backups and snapshots.
- Unknown module edge-cases → maintain rollback via Ansible and backups.

Operational Plan (Day 0–30)
- Day 0: Execute Ansible playbook; validate endpoints; announce.
- Week 1: Monitor traffic and errors; tune Nginx and PF limits.
- Week 2: Add metrics dashboard; confirm Certbot renewals.
- Week 3–4: Harden security; plan horizontal scaling options.

KPIs & Observability
- Uptime (HTTP 200 on `/` and critical endpoints)
- TLS validity (days-to-expiry)
- Error rates (Nginx 4xx/5xx, PF logs)
- Latency (TTFB and route timings)
- Traffic (requests/day, unique visitors)
