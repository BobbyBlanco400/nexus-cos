Title: Introducing the Nexus COS Platform

Today weâ€™re launching the Nexus COS Platform (PF), a unified foundation for building and operating modern digital experiences. PF combines Docker-orchestrated services with a hardened Nginx edge, end-to-end automation via Ansible, and TLS by default using Certbot.

Whatâ€™s included at launch:
- Secure HTTPS front end backed by Nginx
- Containerized services deployed with Docker
- Idempotent automation using Ansible playbooks
- Health checks and operational runbooks

Why it matters:
PF reduces deployment friction, standardizes security, and provides an opinionated path from local development to production, making it easier to iterate and ship reliably.
