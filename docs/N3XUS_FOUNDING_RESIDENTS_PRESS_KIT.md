## WHAT IS N3XUS COS?

N3XUS COS is not a social media platform.  
It's not a content hosting service.  
It's not a network.

**It's an Operating System for Creators.**

Just as iOS enables millions of apps, N3XUS COS enables independent creator platforms — each with their own:
- Streaming infrastructure
- Audience space
- Creative identity
- Revenue systems
- Data ownership

The difference: **Creators own their platforms, not accounts on someone else's platform.**
