## MOTION STYLE GUIDE

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Space Grotesk, Monument Extended)
- **Weight**: Bold to Extra Bold for headlines
- **Size**: Large, impactful — screen-dominating
- **Kerning**: Tight for punch, spacious for elegance
- **Case**: ALL CAPS for emphasis, Title Case for readability

### Animation Style
- **Entrance**: Fade in + subtle scale (1.05x → 1.0x)
- **Exit**: Dissolve or wipe to next text
- **Transitions**: Quick cuts, occasional morph/mask
- **Hold Time**: 1.5-2 seconds per phrase (adjust for reading speed)
- **Rhythm**: Punchy, deliberate, synced to music/sound design

### Color Palette
- **Primary Text**: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- **Accent**: Electric blue (#2563EB) or purple gradient (#8B5CF6)
- **Background**: Deep black (#000000) or dark gradient (#0A0A0F → #1A1A2E)
- **Glow/Pulse**: Soft blue glow on key words

### Effects
- **Subtle Glow**: Use outer glow sparingly on "N3XUS COS" and "MAINNET ACTIVATED"
- **Pulse**: Gentle scale pulse (1.0x → 1.03x → 1.0x) on platform names
- **Particle Effects**: Use when text explodes/reforms (00:10 mark)
- **Grid Formation**: Clean, geometric alignment for the 13 names

### Sound Design Recommendations
- **Bass Drop**: On "Operating System" reveal (00:10)
- **Whoosh**: On text transitions
- **Pulse Sound**: When platform names appear in grid
- **Final Lock**: Deep bass note or synth stab on final frame

## USAGE NOTES

### For Editors
1. Use this script as a frame-by-frame guide
2. Adjust timing based on voiceover (if used) or music tempo
3. Keep text on screen long enough to read comfortably
4. Ensure high contrast (white on black) for maximum impact
5. Test on mobile screens — text must remain readable at small sizes

### For Motion Designers
1. The grid formation (00:15-00:22) is the visual centerpiece
2. Consider adding subtle background animation (particles, grid lines, depth)
3. Maintain rhythm — each text block should feel like a beat
4. Final frame should feel "locked in" — solid, stable, complete

### For Social Media
- **Instagram/TikTok**: Use 7-second teaser + full 45-second version
- **Twitter/X**: Use 15-second cut
- **YouTube**: Use full 45-second version as pre-roll or announcement
- **LinkedIn**: Use 15-second cut with professional tone
