## Post-Seal Rules

### Prohibited Actions (without executive approval)
❌ Infrastructure rewrites  
❌ Removal of Handshake 55-45-17  
❌ Changes to AI governance  
❌ Breaking changes to V-Domains  
❌ Addition of external AI dependencies  
❌ Modification of core architecture  

### Permitted Actions
✅ Bug fixes and security patches  
✅ Performance optimizations (non-breaking)  
✅ Documentation improvements  
✅ Monitoring enhancements  
✅ UI/UX polish  
✅ Daily 30-Founders Loop updates  

### Required for All Changes
- Handshake 55-45-17 compliance
- V-Domain integrity maintained
- Infrastructure stability preserved
- Governance checks passed
- 30-Founders Loop documented
- Security validation completed

---

## Seal Invalidation

This seal becomes invalid if:

1. **Any governance check fails**
2. **Handshake 55-45-17 is removed or bypassed**
3. **Critical security vulnerabilities are introduced**
4. **Core services become non-operational**
5. **Technical freeze is violated without approval**
6. **Audit trail is compromised**

If the seal is invalidated, the system reverts to BUILD MODE and requires re-sealing.
